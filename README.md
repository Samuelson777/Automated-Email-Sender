# Automated Email Sender

## Overview
The Automated Email Sender is a Python script that allows users to send emails automatically. This project demonstrates the use of Python's `smtplib` and `email` libraries to facilitate email communication, making it useful for sending reminders, notifications, or any other type of message.

## Features
- Send emails to one or multiple recipients.
- Customize the subject and body of the email.
- Optionally attach files to the email.
- Supports plain text and HTML email formats.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- A Gmail account (or any other email service that supports SMTP).

## Usage
Open the email_sender.py file in your code editor.

Update the following variables with your information:

- **sender_email**: Your email address.
- **sender_password**: Your email password or App Password (if using Gmail with 2-Step Verification).
- **recipient_email**: The recipient's email address.
- **subject**: The subject of the email.
- **body**: The body content of the email.

## Conclusion
The Automated Email Sender project is a practical and straightforward way to learn about email automation using Python. By implementing this project, you have gained experience in using Python's smtplib and email libraries, as well as understanding how to configure email settings and handle authentication. This project can serve as a foundation for more complex automation tasks and can be easily customized to fit various use cases.
